# Magic

This is a documentation repository for my MagicMirror projects.

I have created a couple of magic mirros based on [MagicMirror2](https://magicmirror.builders/). Actually one of them is not a mirror, just a screen hanging in my home kitchen in a corner up under the ceiling. 

To adapt the magic mirror concept to my own needs, I have created some modules on my own. These can be found in other repositories here:

* [MMM-NesteBussAtB](https://github.com/ottopaulsen/MMM-NesteBussAtB) is used to show the next buses leaving nearby bus stops in Trondheim.
* [MMM-MQTT](https://github.com/ottopaulsen/MMM-MQTT) is used to display contents from MQTT messages. I use it to display data from my smoke cabinet. See my [Smoky](https://github.com/ottopaulsen/Smoky) repository.
* [MMM-MessageToMirror](https://github.com/ottopaulsen/MMM-MessageToMirror) This is not complete yet. It is a module combined with a web app that is used to send messages to be displayed on the magic mirror. The MMM-MessageToMirror module requires a backend system to serve and send the messages. This is done with the [MagicMessage](https://github.com/ottopaulsen/magic-message) system.
